		<h1>My Favorite Animal</h1>
      <p> My favorite animal is a llama</p>
      <img src="llama.jpg" alt ="pic">
      <p>Llamas can get very big, adult llamas can grow up to 5 feet and 11 inches and weigh up to 440 lbs</p>
      <p>Llamas also live up to 30 years</p>
      <img src="llamafight.jpg" alt ="pic">
      <p>The image above shows llamas fighting, they wrap their necks around each other to fight</p>
      <p>Most importantly when llamas feel threatened, they will spit at whatever is threating them. On top of that they will also kick too</p>
