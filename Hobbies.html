		<h1>Hobbies</h1>
     <p>My hobbies include:
     <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Playing Video Games</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Building PCs</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Learning about Cars</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p>Currently all the games I play are on PC. I play a lot of first person shooters, as well as other games such as:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>CSGO</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Rocket League</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Monster Hunter World</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>CSGO or Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a popular esports game which requires a lot of precision, Rocket league is what I currently play the most, it is simply soccer but with cars that can fly. Monster hunter world is the latest edition to the monster hunter title, it is the first game (that's good) to be on PC. Finally leaving hand held consoles.</p>
